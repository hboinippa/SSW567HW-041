 Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code. What did you think was important to do to make it easy to test the program. What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignmen
 
In order to learn about requests and the Github API, I had to look up references. I did this by creating constant files, which made it easier for me to use the gitapi.py file to get the results I wanted. I was able to test my work by creating a simple unittest package, self-certifying to the GitHubAPI, capturing, and executing the package to the output. I used CircleCI to automate it, adding commands for output to be added to the Test Result folder under text.xml file.
